IV.5.12-22. Aff'OTES. LINES 789-817. 113

’γὰρ οὐχ ὡς θέλομεν ἀλλ’ ὡς δυνάμεθα, and still earlier in Plato, Hipp. Mai(
301. Caecilius used it before Terence in a Latin dress, ‘vivas ut possis,
qnando non quis ut velz's,‘ and Plautus alludes to it Pers. 1. 1. 17.
Latin writers introduce a proverb by alunt. Cf. Phor. 506, 768.

807. utinam, ‘would that she had! Cicero is rather fond os using
utinam elliptically‚ especially after quod.

an is often found in a question apparently simple, but which must
be regarded as the second member of an alternative question, the former
being inferred from the context. An nondum etiam? is here the second
member of iam hic suos parentis usserit .⁹

auspicato. Cf. 533, 729 notes.

adpuli, the reading of all the best MSS„ has been altered on very
slender authority to attuli by Fleckeisen. Crito had come by sea, and
navem adpellere was a common phrase.

808. tetulissem. Cf. 832 tetulit. These reduplicated tenses offero
are not found elsewhere in Terence, but are not uncommon in Plautus:
letulemml is once used by Lucretius, 6. '7²- These forms are srorn
a root tol„ or tul-, found in τλῆναι, τάλας, lello, tolerare, ( t ssatus.

811. lites sequi. Gr. δίκην διώκειν. Cf. Adel. 248, Phor. 408.

quam . . . utile. This is, of course, ironical.

814. grandiuscula, ἅπαξ λεγόμενον, ‘ pretty well grown up.' This
is read by all MSS„ but some editors alter it to grandisnla to avoid the.
synizesis. Cf. Haut. 515 lardiusculus.

clamitent, ‘people would cry out,' a potential subjunctive. This
use of the indefinite plural is not usual; an impersonal construction is
far more common.

815. sycophantam. By Athenian law successful prosecutors os public
offenders received rewards, often half the penalty, political jealousy
always gave support to an accusation, and wealthy citizens were often
ready to avert vexatious proceedings by a substantial payment.

All this encouraged the growth of an unscrupulous class of men who
made their livelihood by laying informations, extorting money under
threats of so doing, and similar disreputable practices.

These men were called συκοφάνται. Their name was derived from
σῦκος, a fig, and φαίνειν, to lay informati0n‚ because an ancient law
against the exportation of figs, though unrepealed, became practically
obsolete, and consequently prosecutions under it were considered
peculiarly vexatious. By an easy transition, a sycophant came to mean
a swindler or pettifogger of any description. See infra 919, Pl. Trin. iv.
sc. 2, Aristoph. Achar. 818, Aves 1410, Plut. 850.

816. non lubet, i.e. Crito’s own good feeling would prevent him.

817. Notice the hiatus in Ο optume, as in 769.
