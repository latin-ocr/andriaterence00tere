ROMAN COMEDV AND TERENCE. xvii

the easy yet pointed dialogue, the terse and dramatic descrip-
tions, and the admirable delicacy of the portrayal of character,
won for Terence from the cultured taste of the Augustan age a
more favourable verdict¹ than he could have expected from the
rude and unlettered masses who most enjoyed the broad fun of
a boisterous farce. The above characteristics secured for
Terence considerable attention at the Renaissance in Europe.
In England several of the minor dramatists are under obliga-
tions to him, while in France his influence profoundly affected
Moliere, and is in no small degree responsible for the long-
continued servitude of the French drama to the ‘unities’ of
time and place which have so cramped its free development.
The Andria has been adapted to the French stage by Baron as
L’Andrz'emze‚ while Sir Richard Steele has presented it in an
English dress as T lle C onscz’ous Lovers.

As might be expected, the characters in Terence, though
admirably drawn, are rather commonplace. No personality in
his plays stands out in the memory like that of Tyndarus in
the Captivi, or Stasimus in the Trimcmmus. His morality .
does not rise above a conventional respectability and a civilised
consideration for others, except where the natural impulses
inspire a generous disposition with something of nobility.

The discerning criticism of Caesar nearly expresses the more
matured judgment of modern times :

¹ Afranius writes:
Terentio non similem (lices quempiam.
Cicero writes:
Tu quoque, qui solus lecto sermone, Terenti,
Conversum expressumque Latina vore Alenandrum
In medium nobis sedalis vocibus (ψη,
Quidquid come loquens atquc omm'a duh-ia dicens.
Horace, Ep. 2. Ι. 59, records the general verdiet:
dicitur. . .
Vincere Caecilius gravilate, Terentius arte.
Volcatius, on the other hand, places Terence below Naevius, Plautus,
Caecilius, Licinius, and Atilius.
