understood that no assertion is made which cannot be supported

1. Shortening of syllables usually regarded as long.

1. Shortening of vowels naturally long. This takes place
with the final vowel of dissyllabic words:

(a) When the first syllable is short and accented ; common in
the case of imperatives ; e. g. 300 ca‘vess and so some scan 25 5
a'bz‘. Wagner expresses this in a formula, ό - Ξόυ.

(b) Before a long accented syllable, so that υ --Ιευ υ -Ι ; e. g.
403 cave? te Asse, 682 mane* co'ncrepuil, 760 cave? quo'quam.

2. Shortening of syllables long by position :

(a) By dropping or slurring final consonants‚
m, 91 enlm vero, 503 certo enlm scio.
s, 262 patm's pudor, 308 magfs lubido, 412 eras me, 651
meJJs carnusex, 673 satfs credo.
r, 261 αιηόν misericordia, 301 datlzrne illa.
l, 396 dabft nemo.
d, 302, 745 apzldforum, and perhaps 408 apffd te ut.
η, 271 effla propter, 399 itdn credis, 504 ego'n te, 749 satz⁹n
scmus, 803 ita'n Chrysis.
So, too, l, x, and even nt. Monosyllables are very commonly
shortened, e. g. 42 z'd gratmn, 237 quid c⁹st sl haec, 462 sed ln'c
Pamphilus, 480 ego fn portu, 708 ego Ιιιῖηῐ visam.

(b) By indifferenee to double consonants‚ which Terence
probably did not write. Thus ille is often used as a pyrrhic,
and the first syllable os omnis is scanned short (694) ; for mn π
nn in pronunciation. So 378 zfisus ssa-1· εἶν-π.

(ι’) By weakening consonants of unaccented syllables, when
an accented syllable immediately precedes, eg. 225 quidem
ln'rcle, or immediately follows, e. g. 66 sine Dlvl‘a't‘cl, 466 bonum
Iagdnimn, 614 qm'dem ιῖίιμιμ J‘d aga, 8 30 aitque in Drcfftas, 944
valdjzldtt'. 'l‘hv first syllable os isse und ipse is often short:
cs. 174, 645. Note that in 242, 510, 781 snam, luam, eam
