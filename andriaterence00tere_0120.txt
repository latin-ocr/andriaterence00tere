runs τὸ παιδίον δ’ εἰσῆλθεν ἑψητοὺς φέρον.

ferre, histor. infin„ which seems harsh here, notwithstanding
Terence's fondness for it. Cf. 62 note. But the only alternative is to
consider conveni as=venire vicli, and to take ferre as continuing the
construction κατὰ ξύνεσιν. If MSS. counted for nothing at all, Bentley‘s
correction conspexi might be allowed to solve the difficulty.

doubt that it would have appeared here too, if that MS. had not unfor-
tunately been mutilated. It begins at 786.
