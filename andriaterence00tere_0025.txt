METRES AND PROSODY. xxi

accordingly he persuades Mysis to lay it before Simo’s door,
and, in an amusing dialogue, which Chremes is purposely
allowed to hear, he makes her tell him that Pamphilus is the
father. This piece of information has the desired effect;
Chremes declares that the match must be given up.

Aet IV. Se. 5. However‚ matters cannot come right, unless
it is proved that Glycerium is a respectable wife for Pamphilus ;
and a deus ex machina is provided in the person of the Andrian
Crito, cousin of Chrysis, who suddenly appears and is intro-
duced into Glycerium’s house.

Aet V. Sc. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Soon afterwards Davos comes out,
and tells the old men, on the authority of Crito, that Glycerium
is an ‘Athenian citizen.y Simo, believing this to be a lie, sum-
marily sends the slave off to prison, and is bitterly reproaching
Pamphilus, when Crito comes out os the house, and explains
everything satisfactorily. Pamphilus is made happy, but the
fortunes of Charinus do not seem to have been very interesting
to Terence, unless we can accept the second ending as genuine.

METRES AND PROSODY.

The object of this Introduction is to explain briefly the metres
employed by Terence in the Andria, and to clear up such
apparent difficulties of Prosody as may remain aster the general
scheme of the metres is understood.

These metres are Iambic, Trochaic, Bacchiae, Dactylic, and
Cretic‚ which receive their names from being composed of
iambi, trochees‚ etc., as the case may be, or of some other feet,
considered to be equivalent; and the lines are further sub-
divided according to the number os metres which they contain,
and according to their complete or incomplete form. In iambic
and trochaic lines a series of two feet is called a melre (or
dipodia)‚ and the name of the line corresponds to the number
of these metros3 thus an iambic trimeter is an iambic line,
containing three metres or six seet3 a trocliaic tetrameter is ’.ι
