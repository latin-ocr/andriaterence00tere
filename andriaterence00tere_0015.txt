ROMAN COMEDY ΛΝΒ TERENCE. xi

and was regularly performed by professional actors. The name
Atellanae, from Atella, an Oscan town near Capua, gave rise to
the erroneous supposition that these farces were performed at
Rome in the Oscan dialect ; whereas it was only in accordance
with Roman custom to give to dramatic performances a local

Laws regulating Dramatic Performanees. The failure

defeat of Pyrrhus, 274 Β. C., and the final conquest of Tarentum
and the other cities of Magna Graecia a few years later, left
them undisputed masters of the whole peninsula. They were
