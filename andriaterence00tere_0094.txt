was known merely {rom the private rehearsal before the Curule Aediles.
This view receives strong confirmation, if we can accept the story told
by Suetonius of the recitation before the poet Caecilius3 sor which see
Introduction.

The prologues to the plays of Terence differ from those to the plays
of Plautus in several points: (Ι) Terence's prologues are genuine, while
nearly, if not quite, all of Plautus’ prologues are spurious; (2) of the
prologues of Plautus (twelve in number, if we count the two remaining
lines belonging to the Pseudulus), nine contain an analysis of the plot,
which Terence thought unnecessary; (3) Terence never mentions him-
sels by name; we find the name os Plautus in the prologues to the
Trinummus, Asinaria, Pseudulus.

 

 

1. Poeta, used by Terence in all his prologues instead of his own name.
quom. Always in Plautus and Terence. The Latin writers till
the end of the republican period regularly avoided a u after u or v. So
we have parvolo in 35, relicuom in 2 5 (see note). The correct form in
Cicero is cum.
animum adpulit, cf. 446. Adpellerc commonly means ‘ to bring to
land‚' and Cicero gives the metaphor fully, de Orat. 2. 154 tamquam ad
aliquem libidinis scopulum, sic tuam mentem ad philosophiam adpulisti.
The expression = ‘ se conferre} ‘ to devote oneself to.’

2. id negoti, ‘ this simple task ;' cf.521. The expression is of more
limited meaning than id negotium, since the genitive is partitive. Terence
often has similar phrases in a comio sense, just as diminutives are used ;
e. g. Haut. 848 quid hominis cs ,⁹ negoti. This form os the genitive of
substantives in -ius, -ium is universal in all writers, till the elegiae poets
Ovid and Propertius introduced -iz'; finding, of course, such forms as
imperi. etc. unmanageable. So 44 benefici. Adjectives in dus, how-
ever, do not contract the genitive.

3. fabulas, instead of fabulae, by attraction. Cf. 26, 47. This
attraction of a substantive into the case of the relative is common in
Plautus also, and found in Vergil, Horace, Ovid.

fecisset bears the same relation to credidit that the fut. perf.
would to a primary tense.

4. multo, with aliter.

intellegit. Note the e in this and oue other compound os lege,
ncgquo.

5. prologis, in spite os πρόλογος, would seem natural to a Latin ear,
accustomcd to such eompounds as proloqui. So too przipinarc and Gr.
προπίνειν.
