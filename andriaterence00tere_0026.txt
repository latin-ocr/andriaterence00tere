xxii INTRODUCTION.

trochaic line, containing four metres or eight feet. In the other
lines, however, i. e. bacchiac, dactylic, and cretio, each separate
foot is called a metre. Again, some lines have a number os
complete feet3 these are called acatalectic; while others are
called catalectiC, because the last foot is incomplete. Thus a
trochaic tetrameter catalectic is a trochaic line of four metres or
eight feet, wanting the last syllable, and really containing only
seven feet and a half.

Ι. IAMBIC.

(a) Iambie 'Petrameter Acataleetie‚ called octonarius
from its eight complete feet. (Common.)

(b) Iambie 'I'etrameter catalectie‚ called septenarius,
from its seven complete feet. (Less common.)

(c) Iambie Trimeter Aoataleotie, or senarius. (Very
common3 all the plays os Terence begin with it.)

(d) Iambic Dimeter Acatalectic‚ or Quaternarius. (Used.
occasionally.)

(e) Iambie Dimeter catalectio. (Rare; in 485.)

These lines consist in their pure form of iambi ; but the
spondee, tribrach‚ anapaest‚ and dactyl are admitted in all feet
except the last, which must be an iambus, unless, of course, the
verse is catalectic. Moreover‚ as the Tetrameter is regarded as
being composed os two verses, with the division after the fourth
soot, that foot is usually an iambus ; and such words as eg0‚t2·bi‚
cedo (cs. 702, 703, 705), are allowed to stand there as is at the
end osa senarius.
