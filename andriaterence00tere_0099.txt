1. 1. 14-18. NOTES. LJNES αξξ-4 5. 67

sactum gaudeo may be illustrated by Plaut. Most. 5. 2. 26 (1147) bene
hercle sactum, et factum gaudeo. Butfaclaecm gaudeo sz' tibi quid sccz' aut
facio sounds rather feebly emphatic.

42. Scan et 'id gratum fffisse.

advorsum te = tibi.

habeo gratiam. Note the singular with habco (unlike ago).
The usage is so thoroughly accepted, that some editors change 770 and
Plaut. Trin. 659 summas habeo gratias (read by every ΜΞ), turning
the latter into summam habebo gratiam. A limit, however, ought to
be put upon this fearless support of rules by the banishment of all excep-
tions. The only other instance of the plural with habeo, Phor. 894
gratias lzabeo atque ago, is explained by the presence of ago. There is a
play on gratum and gratiam, ‘ I am grateful that you are gratified by
my service.’

43. Scan sed hoo mihi.

hoe, ‘ these words‚’ i. e. the commemoratio.

44. exprobratiost inmemori. The verbal substantive is often fol-
lowed by the same case as the verb. So Livy 23. 35. 7 exprobratio
cuiquam,· Verg. Aen. 6. 542 iter Elysium. Stil] more remarkable is
the use of the acc. by Plautus after receptio, curatio, tactio (very often
after the latter).

45. quin dio. Note the following uses of quin :—

(1) ‘ why not?' either in direct or indirect questions;

(2) with imperatives as here: this use was a natural develop-
ment of the first ; for such a question as quin taces? is equivalent in
sense to a command ;

(3) in the common sense ‘ but that ’ after verbs expressing preven-
tion‚ doubt, and the like with a negative;

(4) as a eorroborative particle, ‘ indeed‚' ‘ verily.’ Cf. 704.

quid est, indie„ not subjunct. Cf. 449„ 849, 878. ‘ In conversa-
tional or animated language a question is often put, logically, though
not grammatically dependent on another verb or sentence, e. g. on such
expletives as dic mihi, cedo, responde, vide, ete. So frequently in Plautus
and Terence, even where later writers would make the question depen-
dent and use the subjunctive.’ Roby‚ School Latin Grammar, 751. In
705, quid facies? cedo, the mere order of the words removes all diffi-
culty.

quid est. quod: ‘wherefore,' quod being acc. of respect.

me velis, The ellipse of some such word as conloqui seems the
established explanation3 but if the phrase stood in this passage only,
we might be led by comparing l. 50 to supplyfizcere, thus giving a very
simple construction to quod.
