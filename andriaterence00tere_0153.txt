cerium's house, where, as Davos assures the audience, cverything that
rcmains will bc done in proper form.

In the false ending Chremes promises Philumena to the faithful
Charinus with a dowry of six talents.

967. et quidem ego, se. scio.

more hominurn, ‘as usual;' ef. Pl. Trin. 1031 seqq.

sum nanctus, The MSS. have sim ; but the difficulty of sim is
so great and the alteration to sum so slight that we have followed the
example of most editors in adopting the latter.

970. pater, sc. os Glycerium.

972. solus est, quem diligant di. Bentley against all the MSS.
reads solus es quem diligunt di, cf. Phor. 854 nam sine controversia
ab dis solus dilzgrere, Antipho. Others, reading cst, suppose that OEavos
thus intimates that the child has died. But such hypotheses are quite un-
necessary. What more natural than that Davos should flatter his young
master by an extravagant compliment on his infant son and heir? And
the eongratulation was not without reason. A match, against a father's
will, with an unknown and almost penniless girl, was likely enough to
have brought both Pamphilus and his family to ruin. Now his son
would have an acknowledged and honourable position, with the prospect
osa handsome property. Translate, ‘he is to be the only savourite of
the gods.‘ The way in which Davos cuis short his young master's
threatened rhapsody on the baby is characteristic enough.

974. in tempore ipso. Cf. 532 note.

mi. It is better to consider mi as a dal. commodi, ·at the very
’ nick of time for me‚‘ rather than as aster advenis. No certain instance
of a dative aster advenio occurs in a Classical author.

977. atque adeo. Cf. 532 nole.

980. intus 'despondebitmy ‘the betrothal (of Charinus and Philu-
mena.) will take place within.' The Cistellaria and Casina of Plautus
end in a similar way.

981. plaudite. Between the first and second acts of a Roman
comedy it was the custom to introduce a lyrical monologue (cantiam)
with a flute aecompaniment. Sometimes, as in the Trinummus, this
canticum was made an integral part of the play, but more commonly
it was performed by a cantor, who also came forward at the end osa
play and said to the audience ‘plauditc;' cf. Hor. A. P. 155 donec
cantor ‘vos plaudite’ dicat. In all Terence's plays the MSS. mark the
cantor by Ω. The actors are osten indicated by letters of the Greek
alphabet; the cantor, therefore, who appeared at the end of all, is
indicated by the last letter.
