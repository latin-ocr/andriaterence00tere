et eri, etc„ ‘and all through I feared to what my master's for-
bearance was tending.’ It is possible to take semper closely with lenitas,
‘ constant forbearance‚’ a form of expression very common in Greek, and
not unknown in Latin ; cf. Plaut. Pers. 385 uon tu nunc hominum
mores vides, where the construction seems certain. Further examples
might be given, in Cicero, Livy, and Vergil, as well as Plautus and
Terence; but as there is no definite article to bind the phrase together,
a dis-ferent construction is almost always possible. In this passage the
sense points to semper verebar. Davos was frightened by a special dis-
play of lenitas on a particular occasion, because he thought it to have
been assumed by Simo in order to provoke no suspicion of his real inten-
tion. We must add that below (262) Pamphilus speaks of lenis animus
as constantly characteristic of his father3 but the experiences of son and
slave may have been a little different.

quid ais, ‘what is it that you are saying‘?’ Simo heard Davos
