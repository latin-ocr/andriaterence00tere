66 ANDRJA. Ι. 1. 1-13.

28. istaec, i. e. the things which the slaves have brought in from the
market.

29. adesdum. In later Latin this enclitic use of dum is confined to
the negatives nondum, nedum, vixdum, to dudum and interdum, and
the imperatives agedum, agitedum. It is used by the comic poets with
all imperatives (eg. abidum Haut. 249, circumspicedum Plaut.Trin. 146),
with ebo (184, 616). Quidum (interrogative) is found in Terence, e. g.
Hee. 319, primumdum Plaut. Trin. 98. WVhether adesdum, etc. should
be written in one word or two is an unimportant point, on which no
agreement seems to have been made.

volo, sc. conloqui. Cf. 45 (see note), 345, 536, 872.
paucis (ablative), sc. verbis, a common ellipse; cf. 536 note:
though verbis is sometimes expressed, e. g. Plaut. Mil. 374 paucis verbis
te volo, Trin. 963 te tribus verbis volo.
dictum puta, ef. Ovid, Met. 4. 477 facta puta, quaecunque iubes.
3ο. nempe, sc. vis.
curentur, of cookery ; used by Plautus also in this sense.
31. ars, sc. coquendi.
hoc, ablative aster amplius.

33. eis, sc. artibus, further explained by the substantivesfide et tacz'-
turnitate in apposition. Wagner says, ‘ It is quite perverse to supply
artibus? But why perverse ?

artes=‘ qualities.’ Cf. Plaut. Trin. 72 artes antiquae tuae.

35. a parvolozzn παιδός. Cf. 5 39 a parvis.

36. iusta ao clemens, ‘ reasonable and mild.'

37. err, ‘instead of‚' as often; e. g. Cic. Phil. 3. 9. 22 ex oratore
arator.

38. propterea quod, ‘ because your service was given with the spirit
of freedom.' Cf. Adel. 886 servom lzaua' inliberalem, and Menander’s
line, ἐλευθέρως δούλευε, δοῦλος οὐκ ἔσει, ‘For sreedom's spirit makes
the bondman free?

servibas, Terence and Plautus seem to have used -ibam or -z'ebam
for the imperfect of the fourth conjugation almost at pleasure‚ e.g. 930
aicbat, 932 aibat, and Phorm. 83 serviebam but always scibam, nescibam.
The shorter form is sometimes employed by later poets, e. g. accibant,
by Lucretius; audibant. custodibant, by Catullus; lenibat, nutribant,
vestibat, by Vergil; audibat, mollibat. by Ovid; largibar, by Propertius.

39. pretium ε praemium, i. e. freedom.

40. haud muto factum, ‘ I wish no change in it‚’ i. e. ‘I do not
regret it? Cf. 949 dc uxore nil mutat Chremes. It is possible to join
