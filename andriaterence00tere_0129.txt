Ac'r III. SCENE 3.

Chremes enters on his way to Simo's house, in consequence of a
report which has reached his ears that his daughter is to be married to
Pamphilus on that very day. He is in no good humour, but Simo

assurance that Pamphilus has really broken off all connexion with
Glycerium, a statement which Davos is summoned to corroborate.

Hegionem plurimum iubeo. For Chremetem see 247 note.
