METRES AND PROSOJMJ. XXV

probably suffer elision of both vowels, though we may elide the
last only, and scan Uxorem, asse, as already explained.

11. Retention of the quantity of final vowels originally
long. This is much less common in Terence than in Plautus.
Many instances given by Wagner are not certain. Probably
this retention takes place only when it is helped by a pause,
e. g. 437 potin es mi verum dicere:

111. Synizesis. Most dissyllabic words, in which no con-
sonant separates the vowels, may be treated as monosyllables ς
e. g. 95 scias, 843 meo, 296 tuae, 880 sui, 210 lucius, 93, 210 eius,
765 quoius; and so ἒόνιιηι, ηιέὄνιιυι, etc. ; granno-ascula (814) is
noticeable, if it is the right reading 3 delu'nc and proin are always
monosyllabic in Terence. In 202 circuitione seems to scan as

circz'tz'one, cu apparently being regarded as 2: qu.

Hiatus is admitted ε

(1) When there is a change of speaker, e.g. 616, 665.

(2) When a line is broken by a strong pause, e.g. 345.

(3) When a word is isolated by the sense, e. g. 264 meatum.
(4) After the fourth foot of an Iambic or Trochaic Tetrametei·.

It is hardly necessary to note that the interjection 0 is not

elided before vowels, e. g. 769, 817 3 nor is cm, cf. 604.
Occasionally a long vowel is shortened instead of being elided‚

e. g. 191 qutu amant. Cf. Verg. Ecl. 8. 108 an qu? amant.
