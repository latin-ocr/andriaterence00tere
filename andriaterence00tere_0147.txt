dudum praedixit. Cf. 507, 582 note.

841. nescio qui, ‘somehow or other! The MSS. reading nescio
quid is almost certainly due to an ignorant correcti0n; such lines as 340,
Adel. 79, give no support to the use of nescio quid in the above sense.
The logical order is, ‘ct volui dicere tibi, ac nescio qui sum oblitus)
For the ὕστερον πρότερον, as Grammarians term such an inversion,
cf. Verg. A. 2. 353 moriamur et in media arma ruamus.

ACT V. SCENE 2.

Davos. unaware of the presence of Simo and Chremes, comes out of
Glycerium's house. In his confusion he mentions that Pamphilus is now
with her, and to shield himself tells Chremes of Crito's assertion that Gly-
cerium is an Athenian citizen. Simo, in a fury, shouts for Dromo, the
slave who flogged sor the household, by whom Davos is carried off bodily
for summary punishment. Simo summons Pamphilus from the house.

842. nunciam. Cf. 171 note.

em Davom tibi, ‘see you Dav os there; ‘ tibi is Ethic dative.
Cf. Eun. 472 em Eunuchum tila, Pl. Γ rin 185 em meam αῖ aritzam

unum a praetura tua abest.

849. etiam tu hoc responde. This reading is kept in deference to
the MSS. and Servius. Many editors adopt the reading of Donatus
respondes, because etiam is so often used with impatient questions,
e. g. Adel. 550 eliam taces? Phor. 542 etiam lu ltz'm· abis? etc. The
imperative is however found with ctiam, Hec. 841, Pl. Most. 2. 2. 43, etc.

est. For the indicative cf. 45 note.

faciam: or by a pronoun, e. g. lto( facies ? ego vere.

850. tibi ergo, ‘yes you 2 ' ergo is more commonly used as an
emphatic particle in questions, ef. '5¹1 note.
