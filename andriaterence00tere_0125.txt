11.6.11-111.1.7. NOTES. LINES 422-465. 93

442. via, ‘aright,’ a remembrance of Simo's ironical request (190)
that Pamphilus iam redeat iu viam. Recta, which has got into the
MSS. against the metre, must be a gloss on via, due to some one who
did not see that the word has much more point without the adjective.

443. ei, a spondee, as Haut. 455 and always in Lucretius.

dumque aetas tulit. Cf. 188.

445. fortem, of character, ‘estimable.' Cf. Phor. 324 Ο vir forlz's
atque amicus.

446. animum adpulit. Cf. 1 note.

448. quod, accus. of respect or limitation. Cf. 376.

449. quin dic, quid est. Cf. 45 note.

451. draehumis. The old form from δραχμή was drachuma, as
Alcumena from Ἀλκμήνη, etc.

obsonatum, passive impersonal, but perhaps obsonatus from
deponent obsonari ought to be read.

454. quod dicendum hic siet, ‘as far as one in my place may
speak ι ’ lzz'c, ‘ by me to you‚' though it may=‘ between ourselves,’ i. e.
in the absence of Pamphilus: siet, cf. 234. The subjunctive is here
used in the relative clause to express ‘ limitation.’ Cf. Mad. ξ 364, Obs.
2, and such expressions as quod sciam, quod meminerim.

455. quoque, ‘in fact ; ’ for the meaning is not, ‘ You like others are
stingy‚' but, ‘ it is true, as well as declared by Pamphilus, that you are
stlngy.’

per parce nimium. Tmesis for pernimium parce. Cf. 486.
It is possible, however, that we should read perparce.
non laudo. A comic repetition of Simo's laudo in 443.
457. rei, monosyllable here and in the next line.
veterator, ‘ old rascaL’

ACT III. SCENE 1.

Simo overhears a conversation about Glycerium and her child. He
thinks that the story has been invented by Davos to prevent Chremes
from allowing the marriage between Pamphilus and Philumena.

459. pol, a common abbreviation for edepol.

460. invenias, potential subjunctive. Cf. 53, 135, etc.

461. ab Andria, ‘ from the Andrian's house? Cf. 226 note.

narras=dicis‚ as osten in Terence.

464. Cf. 219.

465. actumst, ‘ it is all over,’ an expression used originally in the law-
courts of a case already coneluded. So Phor. 419 ‘actum,’ aiunt, ‘ m
agas?
