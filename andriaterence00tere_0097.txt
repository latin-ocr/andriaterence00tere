merely in the free use of Greek material.

22. dehinc, of future tirne (ef. 190), while abhinc is of past. The
word is always monosyllabic in Plautus and Terence ; later poets seem
to have used it as they liked.

23. dicere. Possibly here and in 535 nubere we ought to scan the
last syllable long, the old termination being —rci; but it seems that all
undoubted instances of this lengthening (of which 437 dicer? isto be noted)
occur when the word is followed by a strong pause. In 535 there is no
pause at all after nubere, and no strong pause here. More probably wc

relicuom. This word is always of four syllables in the older
writers3 relicuos in Lucr. 1. 560 (cf. Munro's note). Catullus, Tibullus,
Vergil, and Horace, unwilling either to lengthen the first syllable or
unite the two last, avoid the word altogether. Later it is used as a tri-
syllable, e. g. by Juvenal.

ACT I. SCENE 1.

Simo tells his srcedman Sosia of the early life and disposition of his
son Pamphilus; of thelove ofthe latterfor Glycerium, and its accidental
discovery; of the consequent refusal ot' Chremes to allow his daughter
Philumena to marry Pamphilus; finally, of his (Simo's) pretence that
the match is nevertheless to take place, in order that he may test the
obedience of his son.

Thus Terence, following his ordinary practice, uses the first scene to
give us such information about the position of afsaIrs as enables us to
understand the action of the play.
