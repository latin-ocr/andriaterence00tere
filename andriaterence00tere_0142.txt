faxis. Plautus and Terence use the following forms: faxo (indic),
faxim (subi), faxis, flixit (indic. or subj.), fizxt'mm (subj.)‚ faxitis
(indic. or subj.),faxint (subi). Two views are held with regard to
these forms: (Ι) they may be syncopated forms forfaccro,fi⁴cerim‚ eto,
cf. Zumpt, ξ 161 ; (2) they may be archaic futures, formed exactly like
the Greek by adding -so to the verb-stem, e. g. fac-so =saxo, as πρᾶγ-σω
»ἑπράξως the tense in -sz'm being the subjunctive2 cf. Roby‚ βξ 291-3.

the forms in question. In the present passagefizxis:ficcm's (sut. perf.);

junctive; cf. the common phrase difinrsnt expressive of a wish, Hor.
