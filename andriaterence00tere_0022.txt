T u quoque, ίιι in sumnzis, Ο dimidiate Menander,
Ponerz's et merito, puri sermonis amator.

Lenibus atque utinam scriph's adiuncta soret vis
C amica, ut aequato virtus polleret honore

C um Graecis, neque in hac despectus parte iaceresj
Unum hoc maceror ac doleo tibi deesse, Terenti.

Not that Terence was devoid of humour ; but his humour is so
delicate and refined that it must often have fallen fiat upon the
stage. &Vhen his plays are well known their subtle satire and
polished wit can be appreciated ; but there is without doubt an
absence of energy and action (Caesar's vis comica), which
prevented his pieces from being dramatically successful. An
audience must be educated up to his plays before it can perceive
their many excellences.
