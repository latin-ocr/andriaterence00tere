11-1·15-31· NOTES. LINES3o1-331. 85

854 faxo (but see note). Cicero is very fond of using credo thus in an
ironical sense.

prodat, ‘prolong,’ ‘ lengthen out‚‘ some days for the marriage;
i. e. ‘let some few days elapse before the marriage! For this use of
prodo in the sense of produco (615) cf. Plaut. Trin. 340 z'llz’ prodit vitam
ad miseriam.

315. adeon, ‘arn Ito go to him? For this emphatic use of the
pres. indic. instead of the future or the deliberative subjunct. cf. Verg.
Aen. 3. 88 quem sequimur?

320. ad auxilium copiam=auxili copiam. Cf. 138 note.

321. istuc, ‘your request.'

32 2. postremum, ‘ for the last times

324. ne, ‘ really: ⁷ only used with pronouns and their adverbs. Cf. 772.

327. principio: μάλιστα μέν; answered by saltem in the next line.

ut ne=ne. Cf. 259.

si id non potest=‘s'z‘l ne se peut? Terence often has potest im-
personassy, or with a neut. pronoun for subject. Cf. Phor. 227, 303, 818.
See below, 861 note.

328. haee (for haece) is the regular form of the fem. plur. in Plautus
and Terence ; probably it remained in use even later. Cf. 438, 656. But
the MSS. often give hae.

329. profer. Either (Ι) sc. nuptiis, ‘ prolong some few days sor
the marriage,' or (2) sc. nuptias, ‘ put off the marriage for some few days‚'
taking dies as acc. of time, not as the object. The first gives an unusual
sense to prqferre, but the striking parallel in 313 is almost decisive in
its favour.

dum proficiscor. We might expect the subjunctive, as the idea
of purpose, not of time, is prominent. But after verbs of ‘waiting ’ and
suehlike dum and the indic. is found even in Cicero. Cf. Cic. Att. 10. 3
ego in Arcano opperior, dum haec cognosc0; and often in Terence; cf.
714, Phor. 982 retine dum ego huc servos evoco Haut. 833. Notice
that such a translation as ‘while I am going’ disguises and does not
explain the difficulty. The idea of purpose will still be the prominent
idea.

330. ne utiquam. Always two words in Plautus and Terence, for the
vowel of ne: must be elided if the first syllable is short; and this is
usually proved by the metre. It is true that neutiquam is possible (not
necessary), Hec. 403.

liberi hominis, as we might say, ‘ osa gentleman.’
331. id, ‘ his act.’
gratiae adponi, ‘counted as a favour 3 ' lit. ‘ be set down to
favour;' cf. Hor. Od. 1. 9. 14 lucro adpone.
