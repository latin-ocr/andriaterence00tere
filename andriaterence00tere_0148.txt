853. quid illum censes Ρ ‘ what (lo you think he would be doing?
This phrase probably originated in an ellipse of facerc; cf. Adel. 656

854. immo vero. Davos replies to Chremes' sneer by representing
Pamphilus as present in Glycerium's house to interview Crito, whom
Davos pretends to think an impostor.

faxo. Cf. 752-3 note. This passage gives no decisive evidence as to
the true tense offaxo. A sut. simple would here seem more natural, but
a future perfect is often used in Plautus and Terence to express a quickly
completed future action, where in English we should employ the future
simple. Faxo in Terence is found four times with the fut. ind„ cf. Phor.
308 z'amfaxo hic aderit, ib. 1055, Eun. 285, 663, twice with the pres.
subj.‚ cf. Adel. 209 cupide accipz'at faxo, ib. 847 coquendo sit saxo,
following the subj. in both cases. Here the MSS. read audias, but
several editors have altered it to audies. There is no certain instance of
the fut. after saxo in Plautus, and the Augustan writers invariably use
the subjunctive construction.

bad sense.

861. sublimem hunc intro rape, ‘ up with him and carry him in.'
Cf. Adel. 316 sublimem medinm arrzfpct¹51n7 Pl. Mil. Gl. 1394. In these
and other passages some editors read sublimen, an adverb, against the MSS.

quantum potest. Cf. 327 note. The impersonal use of potest
in this and similar phrases is so general that we have admitted it here
on the authority of Donatus.
