I.1.66-84. NOTES. LINES 70—111. 71

of enimvero seems regular in Terence. Phor. 528 is a very doubtful
exception.

spectatum, ‘ tested,’ cf. 820, Cic. Verres 2. 3. 78 spectatio
pecuniae ‚· but the metaphor can hardly be extended to conflictatur.

93. ingeniis, ‘characters‚‘ i. e. his friends; abstraet for concrete. So
Cic. pro Arch. 5 de ingeniis iudicare of persons.

eius, monosyllable.

94. animus, Note the change of subject.

in ea re. Cf. 15 note.

95. scias, suae, both monosyllables. So scio 653, 658. The second
pers. subj. is used here in the general sense, as we say ⁴ one may kn0w‚'
not to address Sosia. Cf. Mad. ξ 370. ·

modum, ‘control.'

97. dicere, histor. infin.; cf. 62 note.

fortunas, stronger than the sing.

98. qui. Note that meas: genitive of ego; the relative agrees with
the meaning.

100. ultro, emphatic, because it was usual for the father of the
intended bridegroom to make the first proposal, as Philto does, Plaut.
Trin. 449. This is a good example of the meaning of ultro.

101. dote summa, cf. 951, where the amount is put at ten talents.

in marriage: but the ordinary arrangement has been inverte-d on account
of the unparalleled enthusiasm of Chremes.

103. Some MSS. give quid Igitur obstat quor mm verae fiant. It is
necessary on metrical grounds to omit igitur or verae. Bentley showed
conclusively that verae ought to be omitted. It must have been
brought into the text from 47 by some copyist, who did not understand
that fieri =verae esse; in fact, that fieri verae is almost nonsense. Cf.
529, 543, where fieri stands alone with the same meaning.

104. ferme in diebus paucis, quibus haec acta sunt, ‘almost
within the few days in the course of which the contract was made.'
Searcely was the betrothal over, when the death of Chrysis and the
consequent disclosure ruined the hope of Chremes.

106. ibi tum, pleonastic, as in 131, 223, 634. lbi is temporal,
as also without luyz 356, 3793 frequent in Livy.

107. qui amabant=amat0m‚ i. e. those who loved her when she
was alive. Amarant is an unnecessary correction.

frequens, used adverbially, =‘often.’ Frequenter is not found
before Cicero.

1 10. consuetudinis, ‘ acquaintance.’

1 11. tam fert familiariter, ‘ feels with such tenderness.' Note the
