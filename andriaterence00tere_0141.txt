one on the lest to the god or goddess in whose honour the festival was
celebrated; in this case to Magna Mater or Cybele. See note on the
title. An altar also stood at the entrance os every Roman house.

verbenas, the boughs of the sacred trees, such as 1aur‚el‚ olive,
myrtle, with which altars were wreathed. Such boughs were borne by
Fctiales and suppliant priests z they were also used in sacrificial and other
rites. Cf. Verg. E. 8. 65, ib. A. 12. 120, and Conington's notes on these
passages. Donatus gives the derivation ‘ verbenae quasi herbenae.’
Servius on Verg. E. 8. 65 gives ‘a viriditate)

728. ad. erum iurandum mihi. The MSS. have iusiurandum,
against the metre, a reading rejected by all editors srom Donatus down-
wards. It seems on the whole best to consider iurandum to be for
iurandum csse, an impersonal gerundive constructed aster opus sit ; and
to take ad lterum as=apud lterum ; cs. Pl. Cist. Ι. 1. 100 iuravit apucl
uentrem meam. Translate, ‘ if by chance it may be necessary for me to
take an oath before my master.' R. Klotz thinks that iurandum is put
sor iurare by a sort of attraction. Others consider that iurandum here =
iusiurandum, quoting Pl. Cist. 2. 1. 26, but the reading in that passage
is very doubtful, and such an ellipse would be against all analogy‚
though the construction would in that case find a parallel in 740.
Bentley and others evade the difficulty by reading iurato.

729. liquido, is one of a fairly numerous class of ablatives used
as adverbs‚ e. g. continuo, crebro, serio, etc. Cf. 533.

730. religio, ⁶ scruple.'

istaec. Cf. 501 note.

731. ocius. Cf. 724. Construe porro with agam.

732. pro Iuppiter. Cf. 237 note.

733. eonsilium. Davos had probably intended to tell Simo that the
baby had been laid at his door.

735-6. ‘See that you support my story with a word or two, whenever
necessary.⁸
738. quod mea opera opus sit vobis, ‘ wherein my services may be
needed by you: ’ quod is an ace. of respect3 cf. 289. For opus with a
personal construction see 740.
aut is the MSS. reading which most editors have altered to ul, need-
lessly. The sense is, ‘ if there is anything which Ι can do, or if you see
any further reason (i. e. to make my presence desirable)‚ I will remain.'

AcT IV. SCENE 4.

An amusing scene follows. Davos, pretending to know nothing about
the matter, bullies Mysis into saying before Chremes that the baby
belongs to Pamphilus, while giving her contradictory orders apart, till
