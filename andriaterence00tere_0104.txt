72 , ANDRJA. 1. 1. 86—109.

unusual separation of lam from the adverb; but cf. Cic. pro Arch. 8·
17 tam animo agresti.
1 13. humani, ‘ sympathetic.'
115. eius, i. e. the son. Certainly not humani ingeni, ete.
prodeo. So produco is technically used os eonducting a corpse
to the grave.

116. etiam: ‘yet‚⁷ with negative, as in 503, Cic. Tusc. 1. 12. With-
out negative=‘still.' Cf. 940, Verg. Aen. 6. 485 Idaeumque ctiam
currus, eliam arma tenentem.

117. effertur, often like ἐκφέρειν, used of funerals.

118. unam, prob. emphatie=‘one specially;' though unus some-
times seems to be used as equivalent to an indefinite article.

120. ut, nil supra, sc. esse pessel.

121. quia tum, needlessly altered into quae tum or quae quom. The
repetition of quia, like that of practer ceteras (which happily has defied
emendation), is in keeping with the general character of Simo's narrative.

123. honesta ac liberali, ⁴ sair and ladylike.'

pedisequas, the waiting—women, who would naturally attend
the funeral of their mistress. This seems to show that Chrysis was in
better circumstances than we should have inferred from 74, 75. But
the point need not be pressed.

125. percussit. Used almost impersonally. The subject is implied
in the preceding words. So Cic. Att. iv. Sb. 3 audivi Romae esse
hominem et fitz'sse adsidmmz. Percussit animum. The verb is often
used of the emotions; but it should be noted that percussus sometimes
has taken the place of perculsus by confusion in the M SS.

attat, ‘ ah !' Note the length of the last syllable.
hoc illud est. Cf. Verg. Aen. 4. 675 hoc illud, germana, fuit.

126. hinc illae lacrimae has become proverbial. Quoted by
Cicero, Horace, and, in fact, by most people.

128. Note the dramatic change ostense throughout this passage.

131. ibi tum. Cf. 106 note.

exanimatus, ‘ distracted,' a common use of the word.

135. ut cerneres, ‘so that you might have seen.⁷ The mood is
really independent os m, and must be explained like that of diceret
below. These potential subjunctives (as they are called rather un-
fortunately) simply form the apodosis of a conditional sentence, whose
protasis is suppressed. Cf. Cic. (le lsin. 2. 17 palera! Sextilius impune
megara quis enim 712v1l11224r11e2v122 (i. e. sz' mgna-cl). So crederes, videa-es, ete.

136. quam familiariter. ·’ with all a lover's trust ’ (lit. ‘ how
trustingly ’). This is an exclamation added at the end of the sentence
to strengthcn the verb. So Eun. 178 labascit victus meo verbo, quam
