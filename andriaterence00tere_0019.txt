ROMAN COMEDV ΛΝΒ TERENCE. XV

as of Plautus, were Comoedz'ae palliatae, i. e. plays wherein the
scene and characters are Greek, as opposed to C omoediae togatae,
where the scene is laid in Rome or at least in Italy. Praetextalae
was a name given to historic or tragic plays.

Terence’s first. comedy, the Andria, was produced 166 B.C.
Suetonius relates that when this play was offered to the Aediles,
the young author was told to submit it to the judgment of
Caecilius. Terence arrived when the veteran poet was at supper,
and being in mean attire was seated on a stool near the table.
But he had read no more than a few lines, when Caecilius bade
him take a place upon his conch, and bestowed high commenda-
tion on the play. As Caecilius died in 168 B.C.‚ the Andria
must have been in manuscript at least two years before its per-
formance, and some colour is given to the above anecdote by
the mention which Terence makes in the Prologue of the ill-
natured criticisms of Luscius Lanuvinus. The Hecyra, his second
play, proved his least successful one. At its first performance
in 165 B. C.‚ the audience deserted the theatre to look at some
boxers; a similar fate attended a second representation in
160 B.C.‚ and only the personal intercession of the manager‚
Ambivius Turpio, secured it a hearing at all. The Hauton Timo-
rumenos appeared in 163, the Eunuchus and Phormio in 161,
the Adelphi in 160. In the same year Terence visited Greece‚
either to study for himself Athenian manners and customs‚ or,
as some assert, to escape the persecution of his enemies. Accord-
ing to one account ¹ he perished by shipwreck in 159 Β. C., as he
was returning to Italy with no less than 108 of Menander's
comedies translated into Latin. A more general belief was that
he died at Stymphalus‚ in Arcadia, from grief on hearing of the
loss of his MSS., which he had sent on before him by sea.
Porcius Licinus narrates that his noble pati-ons suffered him to
die in such abject poverty that he had not even a lodging at
Rome whither a slave might have brought news os his death.
This is probably untrue‚ for Suetonius writes that he left gardens
