ΑΘΓ Ι. SCENE 5.

Pamphilus complains bitterly of the attempts made by Simo and
Chremes to soree a wife upon him, protests that he will never leave
Glycerium, and describes how Chrysis on her death-bed committed her
to his charge. Mysis remains in the baekground till 267.

The mixture of iambic and trochaie lines in this scene suits well the
expression of strong feeling.

236. hocinest‚ etc. ‘ Is this the act or purpose of a human being?
is this the duty of a father? ’ The argument is, ‘if any one of human
feeling cannot do this, how absurd to say that a father ought to do it !’
Is -ne is added to lzz'ce, haece, hose, the final e in these words is changed
into ἰ. For factum and inceptum some read fizctu and inceptu. It
seems to be a matter of speculati0n; in such a case MSS. do not help
us much, as the final m is indicated merely by a mark over the u.

237. fidem, sc. imploro. Cf. 246, 716 di vostram fidem. Pro does
not affect the case of the word to which it is joined, as may be seen from
such phrases as pro supreme Iuppiter, pro dz' immortales.

deum is a monosyllable.
Note quid est si haec ; quid est, sc. contumelia.

238. dare sese. The common construction after decerno, constituo,
etc. is the pres. infin. without a subject.

nonne. It is doubtful whether we ought not to read non here
and in the next line. Plautus and Terence ordinarily use -ne οι· nou
instead of nonne. Cf. 17 note.

239. praescisse ante. Note the pleonasm.

Of oportuit Donatus says quam de stomacho repetitum est.

242. suam uxorem. We may scan suam as a monosyllable and
elide both vowels, or, considering it as a dissyllabIe, shorten the first
syllable of uxorem.

id, ‘his purpose.’

inmutatum. 1f this word is the pass. participle of inmutare
(cf. 275), it must mean ‘ ehanged,’ as 2'12 has no negative force in corn-
position with verbs. Spengel takes it thus, explaining that Pamphilus'
grief at the idea of marriage had changed into joy when he found that
Chremes refused to allow the match. It is much better to consider it as
an adjective, ‘unchanged.' The remark is intelligible enough, though
not quite logical. Pamphilus, conti-asting the changed purpose of
Chremes with his own unchangeable fidelity, speaks as if the one were
the consequence of the other.
