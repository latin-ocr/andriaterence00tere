111. 2. 6-18. NOTES. LJNES 467-498. 95

For the intensive use osper cf. 265. Perscz'lus puer, ‘a very fine boy; ’ for
similar use of scitus cf. Phor. 110, Pl. Mere. 4. 4. 15. Its more common
sense is ‘ witty,' ‘ clever‚’ ‘ sensible,' cf. Pl. Trin. 764. Ecastoris commonly
used by women, edepol by men; cf. 305 note. lllccastor is also found,
in which case me is acc. of ego, as in mehercle, mediusfidius.

488. quom, ‘sinee,’ ⁴because‚’ is sometimes constructed with the indi-
cative in ante-,Augustan writers; cf. infra 62 3, 771, Phorm. 208, Pl. As.
80-1. In this case it is co-ordinate with quandoquidem, which is regu-
larly followed by the indic„ and this may have influenced the construction.

489. vel, ‘for example.’ This meaning probably arose from an
ellipse of a former alternative ; ‘ either other instanees might be given or
this;’ cf. Hec. 60, Haut. 568.

credat is a potential subj. Cf. 135 note.

abs was a collateral form of ab (cf. ἐκ, ἐξ) used before words
beginning with c, q, t. As early however as Plautus abs is rarely found
except before te. Cicero always wrote abs te up to about 55 B.C. Occa—
sional uses of abs in later authors, e. g. Livy, are probably intentional
archaisms. In (ts-pello, ets-porto, as-pcrnor (for crs-spernor), the ὖ has
fallen out. Cf. Pl. Pers. 1. 3. 79 abs chorago, Adel. 254 abs quivis.

490. coram, used adverbially. No writer before Cicero employs
coram as a preposition. Cf. 900.

quid opus facto esset. Opus est may be used either impersonassy,
followed by an ablative of what is needed, or personally with the thing
needed in the nominative. The phrase quid opus est? and the like may
be completed by acl with the accusative, e. g. 740, or by an ablative,
which is sometimes perf. pass. part. as here. Roby ξ 507 suggests that
this may be a combination of quid est opus? and quo facto est opus?
Cf. 523, 715, 738. For the peculiar construction of 728 see note on
that passage.
puerperae, dat. commodi.
492. itan . . . itane. Cf. 189 for a similarly emphatic repetition.
tandem, often used in indignant or excited questions. Cf. infra
875, Phor. 231, Pl. Trin. 642, ib. 987.
idoneus, used as antecedent to quem, where is more commonly
appears in classical prose. Cf. 757.

494. saltem aecurate, sc. me salle.

495. edixin tibi 1>=nonne edixi tibi ? Cf. 17 note, 238 note, 504.

496. interminatus sum, an intensive of minari, only found in
Plautus and Terence.

497. credon, etc„ a sarcastic question implying ‘ do you suppose that
I believe,' etc.'?

498. teneo, ‘ I see.’ Cf. 300.
