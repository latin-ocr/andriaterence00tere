90 ANDRIA. II. 3.15—26.

will rather marry you to some penniless girl (whose parents will not be
too particular), than allow you to entangle yourself with a stranger like
Glycerium.’ This scheme sounded plausible enough3 Chremes spoilt it
by consenting to the match after all.

389. hic, ‘thereupon3' like ibi, of time. Spengel stops after lzz'c,
which he takes as :pater with iurgabit ,¹ but the adverb is quite
necessary to reddes.

390. ei, like ea (392), is monosyllable.

ut sient must be regarded as an afterthought‚ since its addition to
the phrase strictly requires facies instead of reddes ; i.e. we should expect
either reddes omnia consilia inserta or facies omnia consilia incerta ut
szent.

391. sine 5mni=si72e ullo. Cf. Plaut. Trin. 338 sine omni malitia.
Not in other writers.

392—393. nec tu ea, etc„ ‘but do not on that account alter your
present conduct (i. e. your intrigue with Glycerium), lest he should
change his determination ’ (i. e. give you his daughter after all). Davos
means, ‘ however determined Chremes is now, we must run no un-
necessary risks.' But it is possible to take the passage differently.
‘ And do not alter your present conduct (i. e. your professed compliance
with your father's wishes), merely from sear that (ca causa ne) he may
change his determination? In other words, ‘There is no danger in
compliance3 you can trust the obstinacy of Chremes.' Here ne mutet
depends on ea causa, not, as in the first case, on minueris. The vague·
ness of haec quae facis, and perhaps the present tense, are in favour of
the former rendering.

minuerezmutare. Cf. Hec. 616 sed uon minuam meum
consilium.

395—396. narn quod tu, etc., ‘for though you may hope, “I shall
easily repel a wife by a character like mine, no parent will give one to
me‚’' (Ι tell you that) he will find some dowerless maiden rather than
allow you to be ruined.’ Speras, concessive subjunctive. Propulsabo. a
military metaphor ; the bad character of Pamphilus is the weapon with
which he repels the enemy. This passage is taken differently by putting
a stop altersarilc and after nemo .· ‘ Ι shall easily (lispose of your hope,
“ No one will give a wife to a man of my character ; ’‘ he will find, ete.'
But this gives a very unnatural sense to propulsabo ,· and lzz's moribus
for homini sis moralo is odd.

399. vide, ‘consi‹ler.’

quin taces. Cf. 45 note.
400. dicam, sc. me ducturum csse.
puerum, ‘child ; ¹ the sex was at present uncertain.
