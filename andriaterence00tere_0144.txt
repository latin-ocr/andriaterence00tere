non desperemus 7. 1. 56, and non assuescat 2. 16. 6. Cf. Mad. 5 456.
Obs. 2, and ξ 459. In the present case the fact that the negation really
belongs to Davom may have suggested the use of non.

789. ne me attigas. Αίίιζξενα, the older form of attingere, is not
found in any later author than Terence. Plautus uses it several times,
but in all certain cases in 2nd pers. of pres. subj. in prohibitions.

790. Mysis was going to finish her sentence with some such words as
narrabo, peream.

792. socer, i. e. sponsae pater. Cf. 732. A similar proleptie use of
gener and adfinis may be found in Pl. Trin. 422, 622, Verg. A. 2. 344.

793. praedicares, ‘you should have told me before.‘ This is really
an apodosis, a protasis such as si recte faceres being suppressed. Cf.
138. Such a use of the imperf. sor the pluperf. is an idiom osten found
in the best authors3 sometimes even the pres. subj. is substituted for an
imperf. or pluperf. Cf. Mad. § 347. Obs. 1, 2, 3.

794—5. Translate, ‘do you suppose it makes little difference whether
all your acts are sincere and natural, or all premeditated?'

Davos means that Mysis would certainly have betrayed herself had
she attempted to act a part3 the only chance was to keep her in the
dark, so that she could speak and act naturally.

child, i. e. a first cousin on the mother’s side.

803. itan Chrysis—P ‘is Chrysis really—Y Crito avoids the ill-
omened word ⁴ dead’ by a discreet aposiopesis, and a slight cough.
