ACT ΙΙ. SCENE 1.

Charinus, who is in love with Philumena, daughter of Chremes, hears
from his slave Byrria of her proposed marriage with Pamphilus. The
latter, being entreated by Charinus to postpone the match, professes
the greatest readiness to do so.

301. quid ais. An expression of surprise; cf. 137. It is provoked
by some words spoken by Byrria before the opening of the scene. We
must scan data'irne, if the final vowel of Byrria is long, as seems
probable. Cf. Chaerea· Eun. 558.

302. qui, interrogative. Cf. 6 note.

apud forum=infhro. Cf. 254.
ei. F leckeisen's emendation for vae, which avoids the shortening

303. usque :sempmn
attentus, ‘on the strain?

304. cura, with cmgfectus, not with lassus, as the alliteration shows.
Tr.‚ ‘wearied and worn with care, it is paralysed.‘

305. edepol, ‘by Pollux,’ like the shorter form pol, is very common
in Plautus and Terence. Cf. 486 ecastor.

Philumenam, evidently spoken emphatically‚ with reference to
the meaning of the name, which of course=·r‘1 φιλουμένη.

307. id dare operam. Cf. 157 note.

qui. Cf. 6 note.

309. A commonplace in Greek; cf. Aesch. Prom. 263, Soph. Trach.
729, Eur. Alc. 1078, and a line quoted by Muretus, ὑγιὴς νοσοῦντα
ῥᾷστα πᾶς τις νουθετεῖ.

310. hio z ego, like Greek ὅδε ἀνήρ. Cf. 890, Plaut. Trin. 1115. He
says it δεικτικῶς, with a gesture, pointing at himself.

si sis, sentias. The use of the pres. subj. has the rhetorical effect
of representing the supposition as possible. Cf. 914, Mad. 5 347 obs.

age, age, ut lubet, ‘well, well, as you like) Byrria, finding
that his philosophie remarks are without effect. gives up Charinus as
hopeless. So Phor. 662 age, age, iam ducat, dabo.

311. prius quam pereo. The stricter syntax of later Latin would
require peream, as these words express the purpose of the speaker: but
by using the indicative, which makes the idea of simple time pre-
dorninant, Charinus emphasiscs the hopelessncss of his position.

hie, Charinus.
