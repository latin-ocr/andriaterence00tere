ACT ΙΙΙ. SCENE 5.

Pamphilus has just heard from Simo that Chremes has consented to
his daughter's marriage. He comes on boiling with rage against Davos
by whose advice this catastrophe has been brought about, and is only
prevented from taking summary vengeance on the slave by the pressing
necessity of his own position.

607. scelus qui. Cf. 250. The reading of this line is very doubt-
sul. The MSS. read qui me perdidit, or qui me hodie perdidit. N either
reading will scan. Hodie was probably supplied from 620, and perdidit
would be the natural gloss on the aposiopesis qui mc . . . On the stage
the sense would be completed by a gesture.

608. nulli, for nullius. Pronouns forming the gen. and dat. in
-ius and -z’ are occasionally declined by Terence like a regular ad-
jective in ·us -a -um; cf. alterae dat. sem. infra 983, Phorm. 928,
Haut. 271, Eun. 1004 mihi solae. qullz' consili is read also Cic.
Rosc. 16. ξ 48.

609. me commisisse. Cf. 24 5.

futtili, [deriv. fundo, cf. sutis, a water-vessel], lit. ‘that which
cannot contain,‘ thence ‘ worthless.'

610. pretium ob stultitiam :pretium stultitiae. Cf. 138.

612. Cf. 2 52.

modo. Cf. 594 note.

613. ducere. For this use of the present sor future ins. see 379,

note.

audeam, deliberative subjunctive. N otice the near connexion of
meaning between the future simple negabo and the present subjunctive
audeam.

614. quid me faciam, ‘what I shall ‹lo with mysels.’ Facere, fieri,
csse, in the sense of ‘to do anylhing with a person‚' ‘ anything to be
done with or huppen to a person,’ are constructed with the ablative oi·
‹latix-e without a preposition, or rarely with ‹lc and the ablative.
