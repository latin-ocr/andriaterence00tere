NOTES. LJNES 1-9· 6 3

period of Terence the forms in -mzdus and -endus were used side by side
for verbs os the third or fourth conjugation, except that -undus is never
admitted where the verb-stem ends in u or v. The older form was much
affected by Sallust, and is frequently found in Augustan writers, especially
in legal or political phrases (e. g. iure dicundo, res νιψείηηαάε), being
most common in verbs of the fourth conjugation. Ire and its compounds
always retain the form in -uudm, while gerundus and ftrundus are
usually found in Cicero, Caesar, and Livy. The older form is seldom
used for the gerund, e. g. the MS. authority is unanimous for scribundis
here and for scribendum in 1.

operam abutitur, ‘uses up his time.' Abuta· in the older Latin,
like the Gr. ἀποχρῆσθαι, meant not ⁴ to misuse,' but ‘to use entirely3' even
Cicero, when he wishes to give the word the meaning ‘misuse‚‘ generally
adds some adverb or equivalent expression. It is regularly followed by
the accusative in the comic poets, by the ablative later. Utor and potior
are sometimes followed by the accusative in the comio, poets; ficrzgor
always by accusative, with one doubtful exception (Adel. 603); fruor
always by ablative, except Haut. 401, where the accusative is found.

6. qui, an old form of the ablative, used by Plautus and Terence in
several sensesz—(I) as a relative, referring to any gender and either
number—‘wherewith' Cf. 512. (2) As a final particle with a sub-
junctive expressing purpose—‘ in order that) Cf. 307, 334, and the
present passage. (3) As an interrogative adverb—‘how'1’' Cf. 150, 302.
(4) Introducing curses (πῶς, utinam). Cf. Phor. 12 3; Plaut. Trin. 923,
997 (not common). (5) As an indefinite particle with words of emphasis
(πῶς), ‘somehow,' e. g. hercle qui, edepol qui, quippe qui, et qui. Cf.
148. It is commonly used by the later writers also in astque} alioqui, etc,

argumentum narret, ‘ explain the plot,’ the natural use of a pro-
logue, though Terence’s practice is to make this unnecessary by explain-
ing the argumentum as far as is needful in the first scene of the play.

7. veteris poetae. This ‘ old poet‘ was Luscius Lanuvinus. Terence
never mentions him by name, but refers to him as poeta vetus in the
prologue to Phorm. 1 and 13, and, with the epithet malevolus added, in
the prologue to Haut. 22.

8. vitio dent, ‘impute as a sault.' ‘The dative sometimes denotes
the design and operation of a thing (that to which it serves and tetzds).‘
Madvig, ξ ²49- So vitio vertere, probo ducere, etc. The subject of
dent is the old poet and his party.

advortite is the reading of all MSS: allcndlle is given by Donatus.

9. Menander. See Introduction.

Perinthiam, a comedy named from one of the characters, a girl
from Perinthus in Thrace, just as Andria means a girl from Andros.
