86 ANDRJA‘. 11. 1. 32-2. 10.

sibi, ‘ to his credit ; ’ dat. commodi. ·

332. apisoier. The simple verb is probably usual in Plautus and
Terence, though it has often been altered in MSS. (especially the later)
to adipisci. The latter, however, is proved by the metre, Phor. 412.

334. qui. Cf. 6 note. So in the next line qui ne: ut ne.

335. sat habeo, ‘I am satisfieri) Cf. 705, 710.

optumezopportune. Cs. 686.

336. quiequam,sc. dicis. Cf. 82.

337. nisi ea quae nil opus sunt seire, ‘except the knowledge of
those things, which are useless! Ea is object after scire. Charinus is
referring to Byrria's commonplace remarks, e. g. 305. Bentley changed
scire (given by all MSS.) into sciri, on the ground that otherwise est
must be read for sunt, and he has been followed by most editors, who,
of course, take sciri as epexegetic of opus szmt, as Bentley did.

fugin hine, colloquial for the imperative, ‘ be off!

ego vero ac 1ubens=cg0 vero fugio ac lubens fugio .· acz‘ and
indeed:' emphatic. Cf. 370.

ACT 11. SCENE 2.

Davos informs Charinus and Pamphilus that Simo's announcement
of the marriage is not seriously meant, and describes the observations
which led him to this conclusion.

338. boni, boni. For similar repetitions os a word cf. 947, 958.

340. laetus est nescio quid. Cf. Adel. 79 nescio quid tristem video.

342. audin tu illum. Davos’ last words show that he has heard of

the marriage. Therefore Charinus points out that Pamphilus is wrong
in saying nondum hacc rescivit mala.

343. intendam, se. gradus or iter.
344. abeo, given by all MSS„ for which Donatus has habeo, ‘1 have
it‚’ ‘ I know‚'=z'nvcnz'. If habco is accepted, Davos means that after all

-notwithstanding toto me oppido exanimatum qzcaerere——Glycerium‘s
house is the most likely place.

resiste, ‘ stop!
qui me, sc. revocat or something of the sort.
345. euge. The last syllable is short, Greek εὖγε. It is quite

unnecessary to insert 0 before Charine, sor the pause aster quaero justifies
the hiatus.

ambo, sc. adr-stis.

vos volo. Cf. 29.
346. quin audi. Cf. 45 note.
347. quid tu, sc. timeas.
