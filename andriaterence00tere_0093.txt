NOTES.

THE notices, called διδασκαλίαι, concerning the origin and first per·
sormance os the plays of Plautus and Terence, were inserted after the
titles of the MSS. probably by grammarians of the Augustan age.

Graeca, a Comoedia palliata, where the characters and scenes are
Greek; opposed to togata.

Menandru = Μενάνδρου.

duced into Rome 205 B.C.: Livy 29. 10, 11. Theatrical representations

tibiis paribus tota, i.e. with one musical accompanirnent throughout,

deinde duabus dextris]

criticising the performances of his critic. It is clear that the Andria
was already known to the public, or at least to some portion of it,
because Terence states (see ll. 13-16) the ground on which it had been
attacked ; but we do not know how this knowledge had been got. The
play may have been performed before 166 B. C. ; and the prologue, which
we have, may have been written for its second appearance, as was the
case with the Hecyra. Yet it seems strange that Terence should make
no mention of a previous persormance, if one had really taken place,
especially as he distinctly states that the Hecyra had been condemned
