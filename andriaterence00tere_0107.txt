1.1. 134-2. 4· NOTES. LINES 149-175. 75

161. manibus pedibusque, Homer's χερσίν τε ποσίν τε. The phrase
occurs again in 676 without que, which Bentley omits here also. If we
accept the omission, it is possible (with Spengel) to extend the asyndeton
to obnixe, and make manibus, pedibus, obnixe separately emphasise fac-
turum. Indeed, as far as sense goes, omnia may make a fourth in the list.

162. id. Spengel supplies facturum. This is possible, but the run
of the words is against such a construction, and there are other passages
where the explanation is inadmissible. See especially 414 note. It is
better to consider id an accus. of limitation, indicating the scope or
object of the action, and further developed by adeo ut incommodet.
‘ Rather with this very object, that he may thwart my wishes.‘ Cf. Eun.
1005 nunc z'dprodco ut conveniam Parmenonem.

adeo. Note the uses of adeo .·

(1) ‘ so far,’ (a) of space, Phor. 55 res adeo redit ‚¹ (b) of time, 662 ;
(c) of circumstance, 245.

(2) ‘ moreover,’ ‘ besides.’

(3) adeo ut, ‘ for the purpose that‚’ as in this passage.

(4) intensive after (a) pronouns, 415, 5793 (h) after adjectives or
adverbs, 775; (c) after conjunctions, 440.

It is possible to take adeo as intensifying id, instead of joining it to ul.

164. mala mens, malus animus, Aristophanes, Pax 1068 δόλιαι
ψυχαί, δόλιαι φρένες. liseur and animus, ‘mind and heart,’ are often
joined by Latin writers, probably without feeling the contrast very
strongly.

165. sin eveniat. Sin, as usual, in an alternative hypothesis; here
eontrasted with sz' nolit (155).

166. ut sit, epexegetic of quod.

167. confore, impersona13 this and conflaturum are the only forms
used. The rest of the verb is supplied by confieri.

171. nunciam, always three syllables in Plautus and Terence.

i prae, always in this order; cf. Adel. 167 alaz· prae. WVagner
gives camus nunciam intro to Simo, and z· prae, sequor to Sosia, on the
ground that the freedman would naturally follow his master; but
the action of the play requires that Simo should remain on the stage,
and must be responsible for any breach of etiquette.

Aer Ι. SCENE 2.

Simo meets Davos‚ and threatens him with the severest penalties if he
attempts to prevent the projected marriage.

173. modo, shortly before the conversation with Sosia.

175. mirabar, hoe si sio abiret, ‘ I always thought it wonderful if
this conduct was really passing unnoticed‚’ or, ‘whether this conduct
