70 ANDRJA. 1. 1. 43-64·

70. viciniae, partitive gen. depending on leuc, as osten aster ubi,
quo, nusquam, etc. lmc visiniam is a needless correction, and huic
viciniae, given by the MSS, a good instance osa copyist's blunder.

71. cognatorum neglegentia. This means a good deal in the
mouth osan Athenian. At Athens, if an orphan girl was left poor, the
next of kin was bound by Solon's law to marry her or to provide a sub-
stantial dowry. Cf. Phor. 125. Cognatas is not used in the technical
Roman sense, but as a translation of the Greek ἀγχιστεύς. The
ἀγχιστεύς in this ease was Crito, who appears 796. As a citizen of
Andros he was not subject to the Athenian law3 so there is no reason
to suppose that it was his legal duty to provide sor Chrysis at Andros.
He does not appear to have objected to inheriting anything that she
might have lest at her death.

7 3. ei, interjection,=lzez‘.

74. duriter, ‘with hard work) Adverbs in -ἱίεν, formed from
adjectives in -us, are common in early Latin, e. g. avarz'ter, amiciter,
mzmdz'tcr; later the termination -e became usual, but note humaniter
(as well as humane) and naviter as exceptions.

81. esset, from csse, not from edere, as suggested by the older
commentators.

82. egomet. This omission of a verb of ‘saying’ is common in
Terence. Cf. 336. So Verg. Aen. 1. 37 haec serum, 3. 99 haec Phoebus.

83. habet. The regular exclamation over a gladiator who had
received a blow. So lzoc habet Plaut. Most. 715, Verg. Aen. 12.
296.

84. venientis aut abeuntis, i. e. on errands to and from the
houses of their respective masters.

88. quid, as in common talk we sometimes begin an explanation
with ‘why.'

symbolam=oval30>t⁷5, called collecta by Cicero, de Or. 2. 57. 233.
It was the contribution of each individnal to the common fund for the
payment of a dinner. So Phor. 339 asymbolusza person who dines
without being obliged to pay.

90. nil quicquam, ‘nothing whatever,’ an emphatic pleonasm; cs.
Phor. So, 250, and elsewhere in Terence. It is impossible to suppose,
with Mr. PapiHon, that quicquam is an adverbial accusative in these
passages. For though, as he points out, nemo quisquam is not certain ι
from Eun. 226, the phrase is established by Eun. 1032, Hec. 67.

91. enimvero, ‘ of course,’ ‘naturally,’ used also to express anger or
impatience; cf. 206. This emphatic use of enim, sometimes at the
beginning of a sentence, is common in Plautus and Terence; cf. Plaut.
Trin. 1134 enim me nominat. The shortening of the second syllable
