et istaec una. parva virgo, ‘and with him that very woman,
then a little girl.’

925. fabulam inceptat, ‘ a pretty tale he is beginning.’ Cf. 747 note.

926. tum=Gr. εἶτα, ‘moreover.'

928. nomen tam cito tibi P sc. dicam. Crito does not at the moment
remember the name.

eastern coast, about five miles from Marathon. It contained a fortress of
some impmtance, and a celebrated temple of Nemesis, who was some-
times called Rhoemnusia virgo. The orator Antipho was born there.

aiebat. Cf. 38 note.

932. quid eam tum? sc. esse aibat.

quoiam. Cf. 763 note.
934. qui, ‘on what grounds Τ
noram et scio, ⁴ I knew him and can vouch sor it.'

936. post illa, or postilla= postea, occurs rarely and only in ante-
Augustan writers. Cf. Phor. 347, 1018.

937. quid illo sit factum. Cf. 614 note.

939. ne. Cf. 324 note. istam. . . gaudeo. These words are pro—
bably addressed by Simo to Chremes, ‘ I am indeed glad in many ways
that she is found to be your daughter.‘ Cf. Eun. 1036 ssz'o Pamphilam
meam inventam cz'vem. Cf. also with this use of islam Adel. 437 dc
istoc ipse viderit. Simo might however be speaking to Pamphilus, ‘ Ι am
indeed glad in many ways that that girl of yours is found ε’ cf. Adel. 836
bonae tuae istae ratam-s. In either case we should have expected
inventam rather than inveniri. Simo apparently regards the identifica-
tion as hardly yet complete.

940—1. serupulus, lit. ‘ a small pointed stone‚’ hence, ‘ anxiety,' ‘doubt,'
‘uneasiness.' Cf. Phor. 1019, Adel. 228 inieci scrupulum homini. A
neuter form scrupulum or scrzpulum is used as the smallest division of
weight, ᾗ( of an ounce.

dignus es cum tua religione, odium. This is the reading of
A C P, and it was accepted by Donatus: other MSS. read odio. If
odium be correct, an aposiopesis may be understood and odium taken as
a vocative=odiose homo, ‘ you wreteh, you deserve . . .' Odium, like
scelus, is used in this sense by Plautus, Terence, and Cicero, e. g. Cic. Phil.
14. 3. 8 Antonius, insigne odium omnium hominnm vel deorum.

eum tua religione = ‘ with your scruples.'

nodum in scirpo quaeris, lit. ‘ you are looking for a knot in a
bulrush,' i. e. you are trying to find a difficulty where there is none.
The proverb is also found in Pl. Men. 2. 1. 22, Ennius ap. Fest.
