49. Simo divides his discourse into three heads, gnati vitam 51-1563
consilium meum 157-167 ; quz'zlfaecre, etc. 168-170.

51. nam introduces the narrative, as -γάρ in Greek. Bentley reads ac,
Meissner et at the end of this line, thus making suita part of the
protasis, and studebat (59) the apodosis. It seems simpler to leave the
text as it is, so that fuit is apodosis. Simo begins afresh at 5 5. Nothing
will make the passage run very smoothly; the repetition of nam seems
to show a want of finish.

excessit ex ephebis. Cf. Plaut. Merc. 61. The age of the
ἔφηβοι at Athens was from 18 to 20. Cic. pro Arch. 3. 4 has cx
pueris excessit, a translation of the Greek ἐκ παίδων ἐξῆλθεν, and de
Or. 2. 326 he quotes this line, and admires the following passage
(i. e. about the next fifty lines) as a longa nam-atio. He then speaks
of the brevitas and venustas of ffrtur, imus (Ι 1 7).

52. liberius must scan libm'ffis. Cf. dextra from dextera. This is

56. ut animum adiungant, explanatory ofqztod. Animum adiungere
is not found elsewhere3 but Terence uses many verbs with animum,
c. g. adpellere (1, 446), adplisare (193).

57. alere, instead of alendi after studium. Cf. Mad. ἓξ 417‚419.
The construction is common in the comic poets, e. g. after opera, lubido,
occasio: Terence has gerund and infin. together after the last, Phor.
