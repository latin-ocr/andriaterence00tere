I. 2. 19-33. NOTES. LINES 178—204. 77

191. hoc quid sit Ρ ‘What is the point osall this?‘ Davos pretends not
to understand how he is concerned with the conduct of Pamphilus. Simo
proceeds to make it quite clear. The subjunctive must depend on an ellipse
of some word like quaero. This construction is more common when one
speaker quotes a question first asked by the other; e. g. 499, Adel. 84
quidficz't? to which Demea replies quid illcfeccrit? (sc. quaeris). Ac-
eo‘rdingly some editors assign laec quid sz't. to Simo. However, Davos
has not asked, as he ought, hoc quid est? but he may have lookcd it.

qui amant, i. e. in love with some one other than the proposed uxor.

193. ‘Too often he guides his hea1·t‚love—sick already, towards the
worse object.' Cf. 924 se amplicat, a common phrase. ξ

ipsum aegrotum must be taken together ; =‘ love-sick without
the promptings of the magister?

195. sane, a colloquial word for ‘yes‚’ like etiam.

199. verberibus, ete„ ‘ I will flog you, Davos‚ within an inch of your
life, and set you in the mill! Usque ad: ‘right up to but, not including?
Cf. Adel. 90 mulcavit usque ad mortem. N otwithstanding the order of
the words, it seems best to take usque ad necem after caesum, not (as
Spengel) after dedam. There are two threats ; verberibus caesum
strengthened by usque acl necem, and z'n pistrinum dedam strengthened
by ea lege, etc.

200. ea lege atque omine, ‘ on the condition and solemn assurance
that.’ There is no parallel to this use os omem· but, as Mr. Papillon
says, the idea of ‘ prognostic' may pass into that of ‘warning.'

201. nondum etiam, an emphatic pleonasm, as etiam with a nega-
tive = nondum. Cf. 1 16 note.

callide = plane. We say, ‘ I slzrcwdly suspect.'
202. loeutus possibly ought to be written locutu’s= locutus cs.
circuitione, five syllables, not six. As circuiri (Phor. 614) is
four syllables, not three, and so circuimus, circuit, circuis used by
Plautus, some editors write circum itione separately, so that the last
syllable of circum may be elided. But this separation seems scarcely
natural, and circuitio might be pronounced circitz'o.

203. passus sim. This potential subjunctive (cf. Mad. ξ 350 b, 135
note) is often used to express in a cautious way what will happen if
certain circumstances arise. The perfect tense is usual, as here:
‘1 would sooner be deceived.‘ Cf. phrases like lzaud facile dixerim,
‘ Ι shall find it difficult to say.’

deludier‚ archaic form of infin. pass„ used also by poets generally.

204. bona verba, quaeso, ‘hush‚ hush,’=ez'14›⁷51.ca; cf.fizvetc linguis.

Davos pretends to be shocked to hear such an ill-omened word as
deludier applied to his master.
