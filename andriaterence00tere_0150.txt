1 18 ANDRJA. V. 4. 1-21.

Aer V. SCENE 4.

Chremes recognises Crito as an old acquaintance. Simo abuses him
roundly as an impostor. But when Crito tells his tale it is found that
Glycerium is really a daughter of Chremes, by name Pasiphila, who with
her uncle Phania had been shipwrecked on the island of Andros when
sailing to Asia in quest of Chremes many years back. This brings
about a happy ddnoliment. All parties are reconciled. Pamphilus receives
a handsome dowry with his Pasiphila, and even Davos is forgiven.
