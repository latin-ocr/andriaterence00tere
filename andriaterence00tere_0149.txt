v.3.1-32. NOTES. LJNES 853-903. 117

Ac'r V. SCENE 3.

Simo bitterly upbraids his son, accusing him, moreover, of having
suborned Crito. Pamphilus begs to be allowed to clear himself by
fetching Crito.

872. quis me volt. Cf. 29 note.

874. gravius, ‘too hard) possiet. Cs. 234 note.

876. Ο ingentem confidentiam, ‘O monstrous impudencei⁷ Cf.
855, 869 notes.

879. adeo inpotenti esse animo, ‘to be of a disposition so uncon-
trollable.’ Notice, however, that adeo qualifies the whole sentence, not
inpotenti alone, as if it were lam. For esse cf. 245 note. In Pl. Trin. 131
we find adulescenti animi impoli, where animi is gen. depending on inpari.

882. me miserum! ‘ wretch that 1 am 2’

id, se. your wretchedness.
sensti. Cf. 151 note.
88 3. olim istuc, sc. sentim debuissi.
animum induxti tuom. Cf. 151, 572 notes.

887. huius. Simo is so deeply wounded by his son's undutisul
conduct that he turns from him in bitter disgust, and speaks os him con-
temptuously as ‘this fellow.’ Scan lausus as a monosyllable.

890. huius, se. mci. Cf. 310 note.

892. viceris, ‘have your own way.' The future perfect is some-
times used as a virtual imperative. Cf. Adel. 437 ille ad me attinet,
quando ila volt frater ; de isaac ipse viderit ; Liv. 1. 58 vos, inquis,
vz'derz'lz‘s quid illi deventum· Verg. A. 10. 743 nunc moretm ast dc me
divom pater alque hominum rex Viderit. In this case viceris implies
indignant concession; viderit or viderint similarly imply the abandon-
ment of the question in point.

893. licetne pauca, sc. dicere.

894. tamen, i. e. notwithstanding his unfilial conduct, yet hear him.

895. tandem seems here to be used in the sense of ‘pray‚' which is
so common in interrogations. It might however be taken in the ordinary
way, ‘ at length,’ i.e. after all your invective.

896. Notice the change of metre to troehaic tetrameters.

899. adlegaturn, ‘suborned,’ not elsewhere used by Terence. Cf.
Pl. Trin. 1142 meo adlegatu venit. Adlcgarc=to despatch on a private
commission, legare on public business.

900. adducas? Cf. 191 note.

902. ne, regular after dum, ‘ provided that.'

903. pro peceato magno, ‘to expiate a grave lauh?
