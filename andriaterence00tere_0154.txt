ALTER EXITUS.

In a few of the later MSS. a second ending, twenty-one lines in
length, is found. This ending was known to Donatus and Eugraphius,
and is certainly of considerable antiquity. Wagner thinks it possible
that it may have been the original ending, but that Terence afterwards
altered it on finding that the audience showed little interest in the
fortunes of Charinus. It seems however sar more likely to have been
the addition of some later critic who thought the play incomplete with-
out a definite settlement of the second pair of lovers. There are con-
siderable corruptions and omissions in the text3 the language in more
than one place is involved and obscure, though RitschL whose emenda-
tions have been generally adopted, has spent on the elucidation of this
passage more trouble than perhaps it deserves.

(977—8). Ritschl suggested these lines as a connecting link.

983. alterae for alterius. A dat. sem. sing. alterae is found Haut.
271 ε cf. 608 note.

985. sors tollitur, ‘the lot is being drawn.'

986. ‘ The match to which you refer is not new to me :’ i.e. Chremes
had known that Charinus wished to marry Philumena, but had enter-
tained other designs for her.

989—90. ‘But 1 was anxious that our friendship, which has been
handed down to us by our fathers, should undiminished be handed on
to our children.'

amicitia nostra=friendship of Chremes and Simo. The text as
it stands is an anacoluthon, amicitia being a Nominatz'vus pendens. We
should have expected amicitiam nostram . . . nulla parte abducta.

992. detur, sc. Philumena Charino.

994-7. These lines are very corrupt. If Ritschl's emendations be
adopted the sense may be as follows: ‘ What shall 1 say? For to have
found you as well-disposed towards me as before, gives me no less
pleasure than now to obtain what Ι seek from you.y It is hard to
believe that a passage so awkward and involved came from the pen os
Terence.

997—8. ‘When you, sc. Charinus, have devoted yoursels to him, sc.
Chremes, as hencesorth will be your aim, do you form your opinion.’

999. alienus, ‘ estranged,⁷ sc. owing to the matrimonial schemes of
Chremes.

1000. ‘Yon may guess that to be true from my case,’ i.e. Chremes
knew only too much about him and his doings.
