I.1.110-121. NOTES. LINES 113—148. 73

cito, and Haut. 1023 sed ipse egreditur, quam severus. Sometimes we
find quam strengthened by an adverb prefixed; e. g. mire quam, sane
quam. Cf. θαυμαστῶς ὡς. The phrase can hardly be explained as=
quam potuit familiariter, for this use of quam and the positive adjective
or adverb is hardly found till after the Augustine period. Cf„ however,
Caes. Β. G. 6. 26 rami quam late dzffitnduntur.

137. quid ais. These words occur very often in Terence. They
are used (1) as a request for information, when a remark has not been
sully heard, cf. 184; (2) as an exclamation of surprise, when a remark
has been heard, but seems scarcely credible‚ as here, cf. 301, 588, 93 3 ;
(3) to introduce a new point in conversation, or to call any one’s
attention, like ‘ dis donc‚’ cf. 517, 575.

aegre ferens, without object expressed, as Adel. 143 aegre pati.

138. ad obiurgandum causae, ef. 150. Equivalent to the more
regular obz'urgandz' causa, which we have in 158.

139. quid commerui, ‘what fault have I committed ?' We may
say that quid: quam noxiam (Plaut. Trin. 28), or quam culpam (Phor.
206), or quid mali (Plaut. Aul. 728). Commerere is used regularly in a
bad, as promerere in a good sense. ⁴

141. honesta oratiost, ⁴ it is a sair plea.'

143. Fleckeisen is surely wrong (followed by Spengel and Meissner)
in altering dederit of the MSS. to dedit. The indic. tulit is necessary,
because it refers to a definite act in past time; but (μα’ dederit damnum
has only a hypothetical existence.

dederit. damnum aut malum, ‘ committed damage or outrage?
Cf. Plaut. Trin. 219 cum damme et malo, where damno: ‘ sine,' injury to
property, mal0=‘ punishment,' injury to person. Damnum is a passive
partic. of dare, as alumnus, etc.; but the repetition of the verb is merely
accidental.

145. The colon may be placed after fizcz'nus or comperisse. In the
former case z'ndzgmumfacz'nus is an exclamation standing alone, as Adel.
173. The or. recta would be indzgwmn flainus, Simo! comperi Pam—
philum, etc.

147. instat, factum, (sc. esse), ‘ he insists that it is the case.' This
construction occurs Plaut. Merc. 242, and perhaps nowhere else.
Though uncommon, it does not seem odd. Cicero, too, has acc. and
infin. aster the similar verb mgcre.

148. qui, indefinite; cf. 6 note. It is grammatically possible to take
qui as nom. masc. here, but many other passages make the construction
certain. The word would generally disappearin translation into English,
eg. ‘we part on such ternis that he declines to consent to his daughter’s
niarriage.‘
