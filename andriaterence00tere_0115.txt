at any rate ; if not inhumanus (goinga step higher)‚ by amor3 if not in-
gratus (higher still), by pudor. Tr„ ‘So unseeling, so inhuman‚ so
unnatural, that neither association (which influenees even the brute
creation), nor love (which influences all men), nor honour (which influ-
enees all men of feeling) stir me and admonish me to keep my pledge!
Note the intensive force of con. Cf. Plaut. Trin. 26 concastigabo pro
conmerita noxia, after castzgare and meritam have been used.

·282. memor essem, an echo of memor esses ; hence the tense and
mood. Cf. 649.

283. scripta, predicate.

285. vos, you and the other attendant women.

287. nec clam te est=nec te fugit.

utraeque. An irregular use of the plural, since two objects‚
not two sets of objects, are meant. However, it is not uneommon;
several instances are given from prose writers. The reading res
nunc utiles (Fleckeisen following Bentley) is unnatural, as giving an
ironical sense to utiles, quite out of keeping with the rest of the
passage. Contrast 811. It was suggested by the appearance of res
(evidently a gloss) in some MSS. and the remark of Donatus, ‘ legitur
et utiles!

288. sient. Cf. ²34 note.

289. The arrangement os this line is rather doubtful, but it is only
necessary to note that genium, given by Donatus, is preferable to
ingenium of MSS.

quod (accus. of respect, cf. 738‚,2 58 quod si) =‘ whereas,’ and is
a common introduction to invocations.

genium tuom, ‘ your own self.' Cf. Hor. Ep. 1. 7. 94 quod le
pergenium dextramque deosque Penates Obsecro et obtestor, and Mr.
Macleane's note: ‘ The Romans believed that every man had a genius,
though their notions on the subject were very confused apparently.
According to the name it should be the attendant on a man’s birth, as
it was believed to be the inseparable companion of his life. It repre-
sented his spiritual identity, and the character of the genius was the
character of the man ..... This explains the expressions genio indul-
gere, etc.'

293, 294. sive—seu. Each=vel si. Cf. 190.

295. virum, ⁴ husband.’

296. fide. This form of the genitive and dative is common in
Plautusv less frequent in Terence ; found sometimes in later authors.

300. cave, sc. dieas.

hoc, sc. accedat.
teneo, ‘ 1 understand? Cf. 349, 498.
