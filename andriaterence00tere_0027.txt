METRES AND PROSOD l ⁷. xxiii

These lines consist in their pure form oftrochees ; the spondee,
tribrach, anapaest, and dactyl are also admitted. But only the
trochee, tribrach, and sometimes dactyl are found in the seventh
foot of the Septenarius; and the eighth foot of the Octonarius
is always a trochee or spondee. Trochaic, like Iambic Tetra-
meters, are considered to be divided after the fourth foot. As
the Trochaic metre is more quick and lively than the Iambic,
it is naturally employed in scenes where feeling and excitement
are represented. In any of the metres above mentioned the
spondee is occasionally resolved into a Proceleusmatic (υ υ υ υ).

The rules of prosody, as commonly taught, must be con-
siderably modified, if we are to understand the scansion of
Plautus and Terence. It must always be remembered that the
poets of the late days of the Republic and their successors were
writing in a literary language, not in the language of every-
day life. The quantity of any syllable was regarded as rigidly
fixed, just as we might find it marked in a dictionary. ln
reading the comic poets we find that not merely the word itself,
but its relation to other words is important. We have to
consider arcent as well as quantity; for a remarkable instance
cs. 760, where we find mane, ccwe'. The chief points, which
should be noticed, are given below. For the sake of brevity
illustrations are taken from the Andria only; but it must be
