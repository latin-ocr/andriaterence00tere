74 ANDRJA. I. 1-122-133·

149. non tu ibi natum, sc. olaiurgastz‘.

151. In the next three lines Simo gives the excuses (apparently con-
sidered valid) which his son would advance. ‘ By determining that I
must marry soon, you have limited my time for intrigue (lzz's rebus);
before long Ι shall have to obey the whims of a wife (alieno more) ; let
me have my fling now and sow my wild oats.’

praescripsti ερναεςῑνιρςῐςίί. This syncopated form (is being
omitted) ofverbs, whose perf. indic. ends in -sz‘, is used by Latin poets,
(1) in the second pers. sing. perf. indic. (often) and second pers. plur.
(rarely); (2) in perf. infin.; (3) in pluperf. subj.; the sing. and first
pers. plur. being found; but none of this last set in Terence. All the
examples in this play are second pers. sing. perf. indic.; cf. 500, 506,
518, 572, 852, 882, 883: z’usse occurs Haut. 1001, produxe Adel. 561,
decesse Haut. 32. Vergil has direxti, instruxti, traxe, cxtinxem, vz‘xet,
and the rare accestis. See the exhaustive note of Klotz on this passage.

152. prope adest quom, ‘ the time is soon coming when.' Cf. Adel.
299 nunc illud est quom.

15 5. There are two doubtful points, on which it is impossible to pro-
nounce positively: (1) A comma may be placed after ducere ,· then the
apodosis is line 156; or a full stop, in which case the apodosis is line
154, and line 156 stands by itself; (2) nolit or nolet? On the whole we
prefer the former, as having the MSS. authority; also cf. 165, 166, sin
eveniat—restat.

amorem, i. e. for Glycerium.

156. ‘This at length will be an act of disobedience on his part, which

I must punish.’
primum, as elsewhere, almost=demum.
ab illo, closely with iniuria. Cf. Livy 27. 2 fides α consule.

157—167. Simo now explains his consilium (line 50). ‘ I am going to
tell Pamphilus that he must many the daughter of Chremes, because (Ι)
if he refuses, 1 shall have a definite ground for blaming him ; (2) Davos
always opposes my wishes, and I want him to waste his efforts in defeat-
ing an imaginary scheme ; (3) if Pamphilus after all consents, Ι hope
to talk Chremes over, and really bring about the marriage (165—167).

157. id operam do. Cf. 307. The neut. pron. is found after such
verbs as gaudere, studere, lacrumare, where the accus. of a substantive
could not stand. Cf. Madv. ξ 229, Ῐιί operam dozid ago, and 58 note.

159. sceleratus. So Adel. 553 eccum sceleratum Syrum. The
slave os Latin comedy is usually represented as opposing the wishes of
his master, furthering 111(- schcmes os his inastcr's son, and looking care-
snlly after his own intcrcsts.

160. consumat, ‘ use it up.'
